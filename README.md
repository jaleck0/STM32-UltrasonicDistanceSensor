# STM32-UltrasonicDistanceSensor
A code example for using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor on the STM32 using register control in the STM Cube framework. 

Code was tested on an STM32 Nucleo-64 sporting a STM32 Nucleo-F303RE chip.

Distance sensor measures the distance and sends the result out over serial in centimeters.

This was originally a school project in semester 3 embedded systems development in 2022/2023.
